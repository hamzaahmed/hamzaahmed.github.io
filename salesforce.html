                        The tasks and problems I tackled as intern gave me a solid idea of what work as a software engineer would look like. Unlike most software engineering interns who work on a "project" and typically build something from scratch, my project had me working almost entirely with legacy code. I learned about the importance of being able to work with legacy code in C169: Software Engineering, and I'm glad I was able to develop skills not many interns get to develop during the course of an internship. I heavily refactored existing code across the stack and paved the way for a major architectural change inside the Community Builder.

                        I also worked on a variety of bugs and test failures during my time at Salesforce. Because I was on a front-end dominant team, I gained a lot of experience working with JavaScript frameworks such as Backbone.js.
