                        Web Design DeCal, affectionately nicknamed "WDD", is the most popular student-taught class at UC Berkeley. We offer the most beginner-friendly entry point into web development, providing support along the way. I joined as an instructor for WDD in Fall 2014, when we received a whopping 905 applicants for the course, where we could only accept 100. My vision is that we would be the standard for learning web design for anyone with an internet connection.
                        <!--<p style = "display: none;">I began teaching this class because of the high barrier to entry that I've experienced myself when it comes to learning web design. Most web design curriculums only focus on teaching the skillset - HTML, CS, and JS - and don't really teach people how to use them to build a beautiful website.</p>
                        <p class = "text">At the same time, I found UC Berkeley's design curriculum severely lacking, and there was a need for an introductory, practical programming class that teaches both design and programming for non-programmers. That's how I started teaching Web Design DeCal, a class for anyone who wants to create a beautiful website.</p>-->
