                        Throughout the Summer of 2014, I worked on developing the official website of UC Berkeley's intercollegiate MUN conference. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and consists of over 50+ pages. The backend structure was written in PHP by <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/malhotraramit" target = "blank" class = "text-link">Ramit Malhotra</a>.

                            Redesigned With Reason
                        </div>
                        The former website of UCBMUN was built using Bootstrap, a front-end framework which, although very powerful, gave the official UCBMUN website a rather cliché look. The club was seeking to attract more participants to the conference from all over the world. For this reason, the club realized the need to redesign the existing website to give it a sleek, modern look.

                            The Redesign Philosophy
                        </div>
                        Apart from attracting new participants, the primary purpose of the website is to provide all the necessary information pertaining to every aspect of the conference. From information on the specific committees to information on the conference sponsors, this website has it all. For this reason, I attempted to design the website in such a way that the content was as clear and legible as possible. This meant no flashy animations, but rather an emphasis on spacing and simplicity.

                            What I Learned
                        </div>
                        Never work on an entire 50+ page website alone. Although it might be nice to have full control of all the design decisions, having someone to question your decisions is equally as important. This website was my first complete project, and I think it turned out quite well. The conference ran smoothly and (luckily) no complaints about the website were heard.
